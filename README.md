Captain Game

Captain Game is my first Android development project, created using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Android Studio. It's a fun and interactive game where players steer a ship, collect treasures, and survive storms on the high seas.

Gameplay

Choose Your Direction: Navigate the ship by selecting one of four directions: North, East, West, or South.

Treasure Encounters: If a treasure is found in the chosen direction, your treasure count increases.

Storm Encounters: If a storm is encountered, your max HP decreases, and the storm count increases.

Game Over: If your HP reaches 0, a Retry button will appear, allowing you to reset all game values to their default state and start fresh.


Features

Beginner-friendly and simple controls.

Randomized events ensure every game session is unique.

Performance tracking with key stats:
